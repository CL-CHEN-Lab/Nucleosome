# Nucleosome

In eukaryotic nuclei, DNA is organised into chromatin. The basic unit of it is the Nucleosome: a complex of an octamer form by two copies of four core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) together with about 146 bp. A fifth histone (H1) can associate with this complex and it is linked with chromatin compaction. Nucleosomes play a major role in DNA replication, gene expression. Recent studies implied as well a function for nucleosomes in alternative splicing. Although Nucleosomes have been extensively studied in the past we are still tackling only the surface. 

Here we archived the scripts of the analysis carried out by the Chen Team on this topic.
