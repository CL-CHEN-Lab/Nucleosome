# Nucleosome

In eukaryotic nuclei, DNA is organised into chromatin. The basic unit of it is the Nucleosome: a complex of an octamer form by two copies of four core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) together with about 147 bp of DNA sequences. A fifth histone (H1) can associate with this complex and it is linked with chromatin compaction. Nucleosomes play a major role in lots of biology processes, such as DNA replication, gene transcription, etc. Recent studies implied as well a function of nucleosomes in alternative splicing. Although nucleosome (positioning, modifications, functions, etc.) has been extensively studied in the past, we are still tackling only the surface of its complete picture. 

Here we archived the scripts of the analysis carried out by the Chen Team on this topic.

GC content but not nucleosome positioning directly contributes to intron-splicing efficiency in Paramecium; BioRxiv [2021.08.05.455221](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.05.455221v1).

   The folder "Gnan et al 2021" contains the codes used to perform the analyses and to create all the figures for this publication (R scripts and Jupyter Notebooks). Jupyter Notebooks have been as well saved as HTML files.
